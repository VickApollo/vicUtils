Why Greek Gods? Assimilation!

It is easy to remember of something when you have an idea or some image to assimilate. 

This happens with greek mythology, because ... every god is unique and you probably heard history about them

Those are some codes i use on my work routine when i need to automate a procedure or read/write , transform some data.

I will upload more stuff in time.
