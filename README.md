Utils.. Greek utils.


Why Greek Gods? I love greek mythology and i thought that it would be easier to remember what each class does if i named as a greek god because every god is unique.


Those are some codes i use on my work routine when i need to automate a procedure or read/write , transform some data.


I will upload more stuff in time.
